# `dapi models [type]`

Lists the generation models available for a media type, including each model's capabilities. Use it to discover valid model ids and the per-model constraints (durations, aspect ratios, features) to set on an asset declaration (see [jsx/generate.md](./jsx/generate.md)).

There are no CLI commands that generate; asset generation is declared in the project module and produced on mount.

## Input

- `[type]` (optional): one of `image`, `video`, `audio`. Omit to list all three groups.

## Output

JSON Lines, one per model:

```ts
{
  type:          "image" | "video" | "audio";
  id:            string;     // the model id to set on a generate.* declaration
  name:          string;
  durations?:    string[];   // video only, e.g. ["5s","10s"]
  aspectRatios?: string[];   // video only
  features?:     Array<"start-frame" | "end-frame" | "audio">;  // video only
}
```
